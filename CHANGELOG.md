## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The presentation core: `siros-openid4vp`, `siros-x509`, `siros-mdoc`,
  `siros-sdjwt`, `siros-paso`, `siros-qes`, `siros-testkit`, `siros-explain`,
  `siros-explain-derive`, `siros-i18n`, `siros-cldr` and `siros-integration`,
  from the design's reference implementation. Each is edition 2024 and
  unpublished. `siros-mdoc` and `siros-sdjwt` replace the earlier crates of
  those names.
- `siros-mdoc::stored` reads a stored mdoc: its items against the MSO's
  digests, the MSO, `issuerAuth`, and the data the device key signs.
  ISO/IEC 18013-5 Annex D's DeviceResponse is its known answer, and each
  construction rule refuses its fixture.
- `siros-credman` lays out the core's consent entries as Android Credential
  Manager's Standard and Payment entries, and decides each set's delegation:
  `Full` when the set needs no wallet display (A9, K4). `siros-openid4vp`
  composes the consent entry as platform-neutral data (`consent`), its
  transaction header filled by the profile.

### Changed

- `siros-zkp-req`, `siros-zkp-catalogues`, `siros-trust` and `proving/` read
  DCQL, CBOR, JSON, identifiers, sessions and authenticated requests through
  `siros-openid4vp`. `siros-zkp-req` holds its member faults and value macros,
  and refuses an indefinite length through the core's definite reading.
- `siros-zkp-catalogues` reads the semantics identifier from the trust
  service's facts and its stored mdocs through `siros-mdoc::stored`, and holds
  its calendar dates and ES256 signatures. Its session binds the key that
  `siros-openid4vp`'s key rule chooses for the response.
- `siros-trust` takes the core's `Timestamp` and identifiers. Its chain
  reader is part of the crate, without a feature, on the workspace's
  `x509-cert`, `der`, `p256` and `p384`.
- `siros-wallet-state` holds its own errors and timestamp.
- `siros-openid4vp` encodes CBOR deterministically (RFC 8949 §4.2.1), reads
  CBOR with definite lengths alone under a nesting bound, and reads a
  `dcql_query`'s Credential Queries alone (`Query::read_all`).
- `clippy.toml` disallows `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet`, and `split_off` and
  `split_at` on vectors, strings, slices and `str`. `wmp-core` and
  `engine-conformance` keep their ordered maps under `#[expect]`.
- `scripts/check_panic_sites.py` reads a `const` item's initialiser and an
  inline `const` block as build-time code.
- Rust 1.89 is the floor of every crate. The msrv job checks the workspace on
  1.89, then each crate with and without its default features. The workspace
  resolves with resolver 3. Both container images build on Rust 1.99.1, the
  pinned toolchain.

### Removed

- `siros-codec`, `siros-dcql` and `siros-oid4vp`: `siros-openid4vp` reads
  DCQL, CBOR, JSON and requests, and the crates that read them name it.
  crates.io's `siros-dcql` stays as siros-dc-matcher published it.
- `siros-credential`, `siros-display`, `siros-transaction-data` and
  `siros-presentation`. `docs/wallet-core-design.md`, section 10.3, names the
  crate and milestone that takes each of their capabilities; `zkp_req`
  matching and its phase 2 wait for the `zkp_req` plug-in (Appendix A). The
  generated Unicode tables and `scripts/gen_unicode_tables.py` leave with them.
- `docs/wallet-core-architecture.md`: `docs/wallet-core-design.md` is the
  contract of the presentation core.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

### Added

- Initial import of the wallet core, presentation side, ported unchanged from
  the siros-dc-matcher workspace (pull requests
  [#54](https://github.com/sirosfoundation/siros-dc-matcher/pull/54) and
  [#55](https://github.com/sirosfoundation/siros-dc-matcher/pull/55), closed
  2026-11-01 for placement, not content): `siros-codec`, `siros-credential`,
  `siros-dcql`, `siros-display`, `siros-mdoc`, `siros-oid4vp`,
  `siros-presentation`, `siros-sdjwt`, `siros-transaction-data`, `siros-trust`,
  `siros-wallet-state`, `siros-zkp-req`, `siros-zkp-catalogues`, with the
  architecture contract and the `zkp_req` specifications under `docs/`.
- Stub crates for the planned WMP engine core (`wmp-core`, `engine-ports`,
  `engine-core`, `engine-adapter-sdk`, `engine-adapter-server`,
  `engine-conformance`) and the engine specification under
  `docs/engine-spec.md`. The spike is gated on the PR 163 rework landing on
  go-wallet-backend `main`.

### Changed

- `siros-zkp-req-nym-auth` is renamed to `siros-zkp-catalogues` on import. The
  ZK stack is two crates permanently: `siros-zkp-req` (protocol) and
  `siros-zkp-catalogues` (every rulebook as modules and features). nym_auth is
  the first rulebook in the catalogue crate; further rulebooks, credential
  forms and systems land in it rather than in new crates.

### Not ported

The Android credential picker and its registration (`siros-picker`,
  `siros-registration`, `siros-picker-testhost`, `android-credman`,
  `siros-dc-matcher-ffi`) remain in siros-dc-matcher, which consumes this core.
