## [0.1.0] — unreleased

### Added

- Initial import of the wallet core, presentation side, ported unchanged from
  the siros-dc-matcher workspace (pull requests
  [#54](https://github.com/sirosfoundation/siros-dc-matcher/pull/54) and
  [#55](https://github.com/sirosfoundation/siros-dc-matcher/pull/55), closed
  2026-11-01 for placement, not content): `siros-codec`, `siros-credential`,
  `siros-dcql`, `siros-display`, `siros-mdoc`, `siros-oid4vp`,
  `siros-presentation`, `siros-sdjwt`, `siros-transaction-data`, `siros-trust`,
  `siros-wallet-state`, `siros-zkp-req`, `siros-zkp-catalogues`, with the
  architecture contract and the `zkp_req` specifications under `docs/`.
- Stub crates for the planned WMP engine core (`wmp-core`, `engine-ports`,
  `engine-core`, `engine-adapter-sdk`, `engine-adapter-server`,
  `engine-conformance`) and the engine specification under
  `docs/engine-spec.md`. The spike is gated on the PR 163 rework landing on
  go-wallet-backend `main`.

- The presentation core: `siros-openid4vp`,
  `siros-x509`, `siros-mdoc`, `siros-sdjwt`, `siros-paso`, `siros-qes`,
  `siros-testkit`, `siros-explain`, `siros-explain-derive`, `siros-i18n`,
  `siros-cldr` and `siros-integration`, from the design's reference
  implementation. Each is edition 2024 and unpublished. `siros-mdoc` and
  `siros-sdjwt` replace the earlier crates of those names.
- `siros-mdoc::stored` reads a stored mdoc: its items against the MSO's
  digests, the MSO, `issuerAuth`, and the data the device key signs.
  ISO/IEC 18013-5 Annex D's DeviceResponse is its known answer.

### Changed

- `siros-zkp-req`, `siros-zkp-catalogues`, `siros-trust` and `proving/` read
  DCQL, CBOR, JSON, identifiers, sessions and authenticated requests through
  `siros-openid4vp`. `siros-zkp-req` holds its member faults and value macros,
  and refuses an indefinite length through the core's definite reading.
  `siros-zkp-catalogues` reads the semantics identifier from the trust
  service's facts, its stored mdocs through `siros-mdoc::stored`, and holds
  its calendar dates and ES256 signatures. `siros-trust` takes the core's `Timestamp` and identifiers.
  `siros-wallet-state` holds its own errors and timestamp.
- `siros-openid4vp` encodes CBOR deterministically (RFC 8949 §4.2.1), reads
  CBOR with definite lengths alone under a nesting bound, and reads a
  `dcql_query`'s Credential Queries alone (`Query::read_all`).

- `clippy.toml` disallows `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet`, and `split_off` and
  `split_at` on vectors, strings, slices and `str`. `wmp-core` and
  `engine-conformance` keep their ordered maps under `#[expect]`.
- `scripts/check_panic_sites.py` reads a `const` item's initialiser and an
  inline `const` block as build-time code.
- Rust 1.89 is the floor of every crate. The msrv job checks the workspace on
  1.89, then each crate with and without its default features. The workspace
  resolves with resolver 3. Both container images build on Rust 1.99.1, the
  pinned toolchain.
- `siros-zkp-req-nym-auth` is renamed to `siros-zkp-catalogues` on import. The
  ZK stack is two crates permanently: `siros-zkp-req` (protocol) and
  `siros-zkp-catalogues` (every rulebook as modules and features). nym_auth is
  the first rulebook in the catalogue crate; further rulebooks, credential
  forms and systems land in it rather than in new crates.

### Removed

- `siros-codec`, `siros-dcql` and `siros-oid4vp`: `siros-openid4vp` reads
  DCQL, CBOR, JSON and requests, and the crates that read them name it.
  crates.io's `siros-dcql` stays as siros-dc-matcher published it.
- `docs/wallet-core-architecture.md`: `docs/wallet-core-design.md` is the
  contract of the presentation core.

- `siros-credential`, `siros-display`, `siros-transaction-data` and
  `siros-presentation`: the presentation core's crates hold their
  capabilities. The generated
  Unicode tables and `scripts/gen_unicode_tables.py` leave with them.

### Not ported

The Android credential picker and its registration (`siros-picker`,
  `siros-registration`, `siros-picker-testhost`, `android-credman`,
  `siros-dc-matcher-ffi`) remain in siros-dc-matcher, which consumes this core.
